This BASH shelll plugin endeavors to provide a fast and pronounced view of various git attributes when you are under the umbrella of a git repository.  Its main feature, the 'info bar' (information bar), displays the following information:

    - current branch (in 'red' if on master)
    - current cksum (in 'red' if there are uncommitted changes
      and displays an 'uncommitted changes' message in the message
      area)
    - stash count in the message area if you have stashes

Please see the license under source/bash-git.
