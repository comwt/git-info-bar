git-info-bar is a Git shell plugin that endeavors to provide a fast and pronounced (highly visible) view of various git attributes when you are under the umbrella of a git repository.  Its main feature, the 'info bar' (information bar), displays the following:

    - current branch (in 'red' if on main or master)
    - current cksum (in 'red' if there are uncommitted changes and
      displays an 'uncommitted changes' message in the message area)
    - stash count in the message area if you have stashes

The info bar is only displayed when you are in a git repository's path.

Please see the license under source/git-info-bar.
